// Run this example by adding <%%= javascript_pack_tag 'hello_erb' %> to the head of your layout file,
// like app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. Please take care of removing the extra `%` from `<%%=`:
// we can't write the correct ERB tags here, they would get interpreted.

<% name = 'Erb' %>

console.log('Hello world from <%= name %>')
